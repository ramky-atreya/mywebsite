I am **Ramakrishnan Atreya**, an economics graduate turned researcher working on power sector policy, data, and youth-focused energy literacy.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **Energy systems & policy** – especially Resource Adequacy and Demand Assessment  
- **Data and storytelling** – using quantitative and qualitative tools to tell evidence-based stories

Over the last few years I have worked as a **Research Associate at FSR Global** and previously as a **Data Analyst at Datarivu**, collaborating with journalists, philanthropy organisations, and government partners to build data-based narratives.
